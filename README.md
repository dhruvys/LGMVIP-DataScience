# Task 1-Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning.

The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

# Task 2-Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM
From the given ‘Tata NSE’ dataset, predict the stock for28 days.

Stock values is very valuable but extremely hard to predict correctly for any human being on their own. This task seeks to solve the problem of Stock Prices Prediction by stacked Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), to predict future stock values.
